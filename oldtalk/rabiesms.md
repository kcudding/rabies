### Introduction
   Rabies has the highest mortality rate of all known infectious agents: almost all individuals who progress to clinical symptoms will die [@radhakrishnanRabiesPublicHealth2020]. If untreated before neurological symptoms occur, death usually occurs within 7 days of clinical symptoms. Cases are almost certainly under-reported, especially given that incubation can take from 1-3 months following an encounter with a rabid animal. In addition, the paralytic form of the disease is not widely recognized, and so is frequently misdiagnosed (often as malaria). Finally, rabies has not been a reportable disease in those locations where it is most prevalent (e.g., the India government only announced that the reporting would be required in October 2021). Therefore, estimates in databases such as global burden of disease (~14,000 deaths for 2019, http://ihmeuw.org/5wfj) are almost certainly underestimates. The WHO suggests that even an figure of 59000 deaths per annum, which is an estimate that takes into account under-reporting  [@hampsonEstimatingGlobalBurden2015a],  is also likely to be a gross underestimate [@whoRabies]. The majority of these deaths occur in Africa and Asia, where India probably accounts for 36% of rabies deaths, or and estimated 18,000 - 20,000 per year [@whoRabiesIndia], where free-roaming dogs are the primary means of transmission.  In this contribution, we use simple optimization techniques to show that the most cost-effective vaccination campaign for eradicating rabies in India may include vaccination of these free-roaming dogs using oral baits, which are not currently part of India's management of rabies.

   Although rabies is a fatal disease, it can be prevented by timely and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis, which is almost 100% effective in preventing death [@whoUnitedRabiesCollaboration]. There are about 29 million post-bite vaccinations delivered each year [@whoRabies], which are estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of rabies deaths annually. The disease is disproportionately found in rural poor populations, where about half of cases are in children under 15 years of age [@whoRabies]. Treatment costs may be a heavy burden for this population and involve travel costs, with resulting income losses, not incurred by those in urban centers. In addition, livestock losses due to rabies were estimated at 62 million (CI 29 - 237 million) [@hampsonEstimatingGlobalBurden2015a] and again, may be disproportionately borne by those in poorer rural areas. It has been estimated 83% of the total rabies control budget in both Asia and Africa is put towards post exposure treatment [@knobelReevaluatingBurdenRabies2005], even though, because of out-of-pocket expenses, a portion of those treated do not finish the course of post-exposure vaccinations. @hampsonEstimatingGlobalBurden2015a estimated the global welfare impact of human rabies at 3.7 million disability-adjusted human life years (DALYs) lost every year, with a related the global economic burden of ~ US$ 8.6 billion per year [@whoRabiesFactsheeta]. The majority (~75%) of these estimated of these economic losses are due to premature death and costs associated with seeking treatment. 
   
   In the past few years, there has been increased focus on eliminating this disease. The WHO, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and OIE (World Organization for Animal Health), have prioritized rabies as a model disease for a One Health approach. One Health refers to the collaboration between different disciplines and sectors to recognize the connection between humans, animals, and the environment, and the necessity for integrated health interventions. These agencies have launched the ‘United Against Rabies Forum’ which advocates and prioritizes investments in rabies control, and coordinates the global rabies-elimination efforts to achieve zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 [@worldhealthorganizationZero30Global2018]. However, it is worth noting that these campaigns are not financial. Moreover, most charitable donations associated with rabies control are commitments to contribute to the costs of post-exposure treatment in endemic regions (e.g., -[@warrellTimeReviseStrategy2021]), while investment in dog vaccination has been judged insufficient.
   
   Over 99% of cases of human rabies are caused by an infected dog bite [@whoRabiesFactsheeta]. There are no documented events of human to human transmission other than in the case of organ transplants. Almost all human deaths occur in Asia and Africa, where there are free-roaming dog populations. The WHO suggests that vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and reduces both human deaths and the need for post-exposure treatment [@whoRabiesFactsheeta].  Investment in dog vaccination accounts for less than 1.5% of the global economic burden of the disease, with considerably smaller investments for Asian and African countries [@hampsonEstimatingGlobalBurden2015a].  For example, until recently large scale dog vaccination activities in India accounted for less than 0.5% of the estimated economic burden from the disease [@hampsonEstimatingGlobalBurden2015a].
   
   With funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO ran programs to control canine rabies at three locations: South-eastern Tanzania; Cebu Province in the Philippines; and KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa beginning in 2010 [@elserCanineRabiesElimination2018]. The cost per dog vaccinated varied (US$  2012 1.18 - 15.62), but were lower with higher human and dog density, since implementation of the program rather than the cost of the vaccine itself was the largest portion of cost. In contrast, the cost of the average human post-exposure treatment in these areas for this period ranged from US$ 44.91 to US$ 64.38 even though many bite victims did not receive the full course of treatment, and very few (1 - 9%) received a more expensive immunoglobulin treatment.  A recent cost-comparison in Chad suggests canine mass vaccination has a higher cost-effectiveness per DALY averted than post-exposure human treatment alone and is less costly over a period of 15–20 years [@mindekemCostDescriptionComparative2017].
   
   Ecological modeling studies and field experience indicate that the annual vaccination of over 70% of the dog population can stop transmission and eventually lead to elimination if repeated over several years (e.g., -[@colemanImmunizationCoverageRequired1996]).  Previous mass vaccination campaigns targeting dogs have been highly successful in many countries, and are cost-effective. For example, through widespread pet vaccination campaigns, the U.S. was able to eliminate the canine rabies variant in the late 1970s and again in the 2000s. Current widely-used strategies for dog vaccination include central point vaccination, door-to-door, and catch-vaccinate-release. Central point vaccination (CP) is where dog owners bring their pets to a central location such as a veterinarian office, or a community clinic during a vaccination blitz. Door-to-door (DD) strategies are where teams move from house-to-house to vaccinate dogs that can be handled by their owners. These two strategies have only been successful at large scale where most dogs are responsibly owned (e.g., Latin America; -[@vigilatoRabiesUpdateLatin2013]).
   
   In countries like India, where there are many free-roaming dogs that may or may not be owned (REF), catch-vaccinate-release techniques (CVR) have been combined with door-to-door strategies. For animals that cannot be easily handled, catch-vaccinate-release entails a team of people capturing the animal in a net, injecting the vaccine and then releasing. For example, Mission Rabies uses conventional injection with both DD approaches and CVR to vaccinate liminal dogs in India. In 2013, the charity conducted synchronized mass dog vaccination campaigns in 12 cities using CVR. They vaccinated 54,227 dogs with an average vaccination rate of 14.6 (CI 10- 20) dogs/person/day [@gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a]. Post vaccination surveys at five of the sites indicated coverage rates of about 71.2%. To date, however, there is no example of a large-scale, national campaign that relies primarily on CVR. @wallaceRoleOralRabies2020a suggest that the large labor force required for such a campaign probably does not exist in many countries. 
   
   @wallaceRoleOralRabies2020a and @gibsonOralBaitHandout2019 promote oral vaccine bait handouts as a key strategy in the control of canine rabies where there are large populations of free-roaming dogs. The WHO has also been recommending oral bait handouts as a complementary measure to reach inaccessible dogs since at least 1998 [@whoconsultationonfieldapplicationoforalrabiesvaccinefordogs1998:genevaFieldApplicationOral1998]. Oral vaccination strategies involve providing attractive oral vaccine baits to animals that cannot be easily handled. Oral baits have been used successfully in North America and Europe to control rabies in a variety of wildlife species.  For the past 30 years the US has held back the spread of rabies in raccoons to the western states, after the disease was introduced to Virginia. The National Rabies Management Program is the largest coordinated effort to control a zoonotic disease in wildlife populations ever undertaken in the U.S. The program costs about $28 million to run every year (see -[@slateOralRabiesVaccination2002]), but it’s estimated to save taxpayers [$60 million](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/wildlife_damage/2016/fsc-preventing-wildlife-rabies.pdf) in preventing the need for public health investigations, animal rabies tests, and access to post-exposure vaccines for humans. In 2019, the USDA and its partner agencies and organizations estimated they distributed about 9.3 million raccoon rabies vaccine baits in a line roughly 25 miles wide that runs from Maine down to Alabama.
   
   It is likely that the use of oral rabies baits to vaccinate free-roaming dog populations could be similarly effective. In India, Mission Rabies conducted a pilot test of oral baiting in Goa, India in 2018 ([Mission Rabies](http://www.missionrabies.com/blog/oral-vaccines-could-provide-the-answer-to-rabies-elimination-in-stray-dogs)), where two vaccination strategies were compared. Either teams of two traveled by scooter and offered dogs an empty oral bait construct (handout method), or teams of seven traveled by supply vehicle and used nets to catch dogs for parenteral vaccination [@gibsonOralBaitHandout2019]. The fixed operational team cost of catch-vaccinate-release was four times higher than oral bait handouts, at $127 USD per day, compared to $34 USD per day. Use of oral baits also increased the proportion of dogs accessible for vaccination by 17% overall, and consistently reached a larger proportion of animals across land use types. Staff also reported that dogs are more likely to run away from the net catching teams and alert dogs in the area by barking, while oral bait teams reported that dogs were often attracted to the baits and would gather around them.

@wallaceEstimatingEffectivenessVaccine2019c have developed a spreadsheet tool to estimate the costs and potential wastage of vaccines when implementing different vaccination campaigns. @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a have used these tools to estimate and compare the costs of various vaccination strategies in various Indian cities. This tool assumes that a number of vaccine doses has been purchased and allows the user to choose various vaccination strategies and examine their cost performance. Rather than having the user devise various vaccination strategies and compare them, it may be useful to determine the strategy for a given population that would minimize costs. We use previously estimated costs to calculate the optimal vaccination strategy while maintaining a target level of vaccination. We show that for the scenarios examined, the optimal strategy for vaccination almost always includes oral baits, up to a maximum threshold price for the vaccination bait.

### Methods
We use linear programming to determine the optimal combination of rabies vaccination methods for dog populations with a range of free-roaming animals.  Following @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a and @wallaceEstimatingEffectivenessVaccine2019c we consider the population to be divided into 3 categories of dogs: always confined (C), sometimes confined (SC) 
and never confined (NC). Never confined (NC) dogs are the most problematic population for vaccination. We varying population percentage of NC dogs in order to address a range of implementation scenarios, and divide the remaining population evenly between C and SC dogs.

We have 4 different methods of vaccination: central point (CP) where the owners take the dog to the veterinary office or a central vaccination clinic), door to door (DD), where a small 2 person crew knocks on doors in an area and offers to vaccinate dogs, catch, vaccinate, release (CVR) where a large 5 person crew using a large vehicle capture free-roaming dogs in a net, restrain and vaccinate them, and oral bait handout (ORV) where a small 2 person crew hands out oral vaccine baits to free-roaming dogs.

#### Vaccination costs
We use a selection of the mean costs estimates in USD proposed by @wallaceEstimatingEffectivenessVaccine2019c and adapted for the city of Bangalore by @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a. Those costs that could expressed a priori as a per dog expense were used for the optimization procedure.  Once the optimal vaccination strategy was selected on these costs, the total cost of the campaign was calculated for that strategy, and used to yield a final per dog cost. 

Some costs for consumables were already provided on a per dog cost (e.g., vaccines, syringes, certificates and dog marking) by @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a. However, since there is considerable uncertainly regarding the exact price of the oral bait construct for use in India (Wallace ref here), we allow the oral bait cost to vary from $0.50 to $5.50 in our calculations (@gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a used a minimum, mean  and maximum values of 1.50, 2.00 and 2.50 respectively)

Costs that were not be expressed per dog included vehicle rentals, equipment and staff wages that would scale with a given number of vaccinations (e.g., the costs of CVR include among other things, the cost of renting a van, the budgeted expense of treating employees that received a bite, and the salary of a driver). To obtain personnel costs per dog vaccination, the number of employees required to implement each vaccination were set at 1 person for CP, 2 for DD and ORV and 4 for CVR, with a per person vaccination capacity of 30 dogs/person/day for injection and 50 dogs/person/day for oral baits (taken from the Bangalore spreadsheet in @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a). In addition, a driver was required for CVR. Using the daily wages provided by @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a, we can then calculate the per dog cost of personnel. Naturally these costs may vary wildly with location, but in general, the most expensive item is likely to be salary. We confirmed that the rates used by @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a ($12, $13, $11,  $13 daily wage for technicians using CP, DD, CVR and OBR vaccination respectively, and $8 for the driver) were in still currently in the range reported by XXXX for India, although there may have been changes over time.

The per dog rate of other expenses such as CP/DD Bite PEP can be calculated from the rates provided (1 in 2,000). A separate rate for OBR was not provided, but we assumed the same cost as CP/DD PEP with higher rate (1 in 1,000), but a lower rate than CVR Bite Booster PEP (1 in 500). We assumed that vaccination certificates would only be provided for CP and DD dogs, and dog marking (e.g., paint or similar) completed only for CVR and ORV dogs. 

While DD and ORVs vaccination requires a team of two and minimal equipment than can be transported on a small vehicle like a moped, CVR requires a lot of equipment and a vehicle that can transport 4-5 people. Therefore unlike @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a,  we differentiate the vehicle rental costs and assume that the larger vehicle for CVR will cost 2 times that required for DD and OBR, and will require twice the amount of gasoline. This estimate is conservative, since if mopeds could indeed be used for DD and ORV, and a larger vehicle such as a minivan was needed for CVR, a survey of rental agencies suggests the costs would differ by a factor of 10.

 We did not add fixed costs to this calculation since we did not expect these to vary considerably with the addition of oral baits (e.g., a program manager and vaccine storage would always be needed). However, @wallaceEstimatingEffectivenessVaccine2019c notes that the WHO suggests the use of oral baits requires information campaigns, as well as surveillance systems capable of detecting unintended vaccine exposures, which could add additional unknown costs to such a campaign. This recommendation for surveillance seems to relate more to the case where oral baits are broadcast in the environment rather than handed out to individual dogs. In addition, recent developments in these vaccines make adverse effects on accidental exposure very unlikely. Nonetheless, we included one additional fixed cost for vaccination campaigns that included oral baits: $10000 for dissemination regarding the deployment of oral baits. This value was based on estimates from @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a and for more general rabies campaign advertising and included costs for 10000 pieces of printed information and 30 days of radio or car loudspeaker announcements.  

We note that there are no differences in costs noted by these authors with respect to using the different methods for different classes of dogs. Using these estimates we obtain a per dog vaccination cost of $1.03, $2.50, $6.36, for CP, DD and CVR methods, and a range of $1.75-$6.25 for ORV. Thus the cost of central point vaccination (CP) for a never confined dog (NC), is given as the same for an always confined (C) dog. The difference in using these methods for different categories is accounted for in an accessibility metric (see Vaccination method effectiveness). 

#### Vaccination method effectiveness

To determine the vaccination rate achieved by these methods we use two sets of parameters given by @wallaceEstimatingEffectivenessVaccine2019c and @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a in their calculations: vaccine efficacy and accessibility of dogs to these various vaccination methods. The first is parameter is straightforward. After receiving a vaccine injection, @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a assumes that the dog will have a 100% chance of rabies immunity, while a dog that successfully receives an oral bait will only have an 80% chance of immunity. 

The second set of parameters "determines the number of dogs in each confinement category that is accessible by a given vaccination method, using vaccination method efficacy estimates provided by the user" @wallaceEstimatingEffectivenessVaccine2019c, or in other words, it expresses the probability of using a given vaccination method on each dog category. We use the values provided by @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a for the city of Bangalore (Table 2), but do note that the meaning of the accessibility value lies in the exact method of implementation for the oral baits. For example, @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a indicates that CP and DD campaigns will have a higher probability of reaching C and SC dogs, and estimates a 5% chance of vaccinating an always confined (C) dog with an oral bait handout. However, it is of course entirely possible to have a door to door campaign that employs oral baits instead of injections, and it may be cheaper and more effective to do so if trained personal to administer injections are too costly, or the probability of owners responding to calls to attend CP vaccination locations is to low. 

Table: Vaccination accessibility from @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a

|   |   CP|   DD|  CVR|  ORV|
|:--|----:|----:|----:|----:|
|C  | 0.95| 0.95| 0.05| 0.05|
|SC | 0.80| 0.80| 0.70| 0.95|
|NC | 0.05| 0.10| 0.64| 0.79|

These values are of efficacy and accessibility are multiplied to determine the maximum effectiveness of a given method for a given dog category. Since parenteral vaccine efficacy is estimated at 100%, only oral baits coverage will be changed. For example,  ORV can reach 79% of NC dogs, but since it has an estimated 80% efficacy once administered, use of this method will have a maximum coverage of 63% if each dog consumes only one bait, similar to the maximum coverage rate 64% of CVR for these dogs.

#### Optimization

To determine optimal delivery solutions, we use linear programming to minimize over per dog costs. This approach has been used for other similar health care problems (e.g., @earnshaw2002optimal). To include the uncertainty regarding oral bait costs we found the optimal solution across a range of possible cost.  Similarly, the number of NC dogs in a given region is most uncertain. We therefore varied the given percentage of NC dogs in the total population, and divided the remaining dogs evenly between the C and SC categories.

Our objective function is  $$\min\sum \sum {c_j}x_{ij},$$ where $c_j$ is the cost for each vaccination method,  and $x_{ij}$ is the number of dogs vaccinated in each category, $i$ by method $j$. 

 Where solutions were possible, we compared to those without the option of oral bait delivery in order to determine if costs were lowered by incorporating this vaccination technique. Optimal solutions were found using lpSolve, an R interface to the freely available software lp_solve (version 5.5) https://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/.

#### Constraints to achieve rabies vaccination targets
 In addition to minimizing costs,  we added constraints to set the minimum percentage of dogs successfully vaccinated to ensure that  disease transmission was halted or at least slowed (e.g., $R_0<1$).  We use 0.7 as the minimum annual vaccination rate for $R_0<1$  \citep[e.g.][]{colemanImmunizationCoverageRequired1996} required for rabies control, and add that constraint for C and SC dog categories as: $i$, $\sum{x_{i}v_{ij}} \geq 0.7d_i$, where $d_i$ is the number of dogs in each category in the population,  $v_{ij}$ is the efficacy of method $j$ on dog category $i$. 

Given the vaccine efficacy and accessibility given by @gibsonReviewingSolutionsScale2020a, this 70% vaccination target cannot be met for NC dogs. However, rabies may have relatively low transmission rates, such that in some populations vaccination coverage of even a small percentage of the dog population may be sufficient to substantially reduce economic and DALY impacts. For example, @fitzpatrickOneHealthApproach2016b predict an 88% reduction in annual human rabies deaths for an ongoing program of canine vaccination that reaches $\approx$∼13% of the overall dog population. We therefore set the vaccination target for NC dogs at 60%, to fall slightly below the maximum possible coverage for CVR and ORV.

Another option is to set a 70% vaccination target for the combined transmission category of free-roaming dogs which includes both NC and SC dogs, as well as 70% of C dogs. Solutions that meet this constraint can only be found where NC dogs comprise <50% of the population in campaigns that use oral baits, if only one vaccination attempt is made per dog, and the remaining dog population is divided evenly between SC and C dogs (See Appendix 1).

#### Optimization with probabilistic constraints
We also investigated solutions where the probability of reaching the specified constraint vaccination constraints were met with either a 20% probability or a 70% probability, on the grounds that lower probabilities of meeting vaccination targets may be sufficient for significant positive impact as suggested by @fitzpatrickOneHealthApproach2016b. 

To incorporate a probabilistic approach to meeting vaccination targets, we use a chance constraint optimization procedure (e.g., @geletuAdvancesApplicationsChanceconstrained2013).  We impose the constraint that for each dog category, $i$, $$ P \left( \sum x_{ij} v_{ij} \geq \zeta_{i} )\right) \geq p,$$  where $v_{ij}$ is the effectiveness of method $j$ on dog category $i$ and $\zeta_i$ is the number of vaccinated dogs required to achieve the desired vaccination coverage, and p is a given probability. 

Then, we can relax the problem into the equivalent deterministic problem by using the appropriate probability density function and substituting the left hand side of the constraint with a deterministic expression. If we assume that $\zeta_i$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma^2_i$, we can transform the constraint for each i into $$P\left(\sum x_{ij}v_{ij}\right) \ge \mu_i + \sigma_i q_p,$$ where $q_p$ is the p-quantile of the standard normal distribution. We then assume that the dog population estimates were normally distributed with means as previously indicated and variance set as 20% of the mean. After this, we then solve as usual for a given p. However, we note that issues with convexity and stability can mean that small changes in the actual density function could cause major changes in the optimal solution. 

### Results
Optimization suggests that, for a fixed percentage of free-roaming dogs of 0.4 in a total population of 50,000, the use of oral baits will result in a lower per dog costs for the campaign, until a fairly high oral bait cost of $4.50 (Figure \ref{fig:breakeven}). 

![Total per dog costs for vaccination campaigns with and without the use of oral baits](breakeven2.jpeg){#fig:breakeven}

We find a similar price threshold across a range of percent NC dogs in the population. For this population size of 50000 dogs, unless the percentage of NC dogs is less than 20% of the population, or the oral bait price is greater than $5.00, the use of this vaccination method will always result in lower per dog costs for the total campaign  (Figure \ref{fig:surfacecost}). 

![Difference between total per dog costs for optimal vaccination strategies with and without oral baits](surfacecost2.jpeg){#fig:surfacecost}

With a larger population size, or higher percentage of NC dogs, this price threshold is even higher (e.g., $4.85 for 100,000 dogs, see Figure \ref{fig:breaksize}). However, for small populations with low numbers of NC dogs, there may be no cost advantage.

![Per unit cost oral rabies vaccine bait at which there would no longer be a cost advantage for a range of total dog population size and percent of never confined (NC) dogs in the population ](breaksize.jpeg){#fig:breaksize}

We examined the optimal solutions across the range of oral bait price and percentage of free-roaming dogs using a kmeans cluster analysis. There are three major categories of solution for NC dogs, but CP vaccination is always suggested for C and SC dogs.  If the oral bait cost is less than than ~$5.00, and the percentage of NC dogs in the population is >~50%, the optimal strategy is to always use oral baits for NC dogs. At lower percentages of NC dogs, a mixed strategy of CVR and ORV should be used. When oral baits cost more than $5.00, CVR should be used unless the percentage of dogs is less than ~30%, in which case a mixed strategy should be used (Figure \ref{fig:stratsurf}).

Where we allow our vaccination constraints to be probabilistic, in a population of 50000, we will need to vaccinate ~10% more dogs ((5500-6400; see Figure \ref{fig:20vs70}) to have 70% probability of meeting our coverage targets, vs having only 20% probability of doing so.  Note that as the percentage of NC dogs increases, we need to vaccination nearly the entire population to have higher confidence in meeting our targets of 60% of NC dogs and 70% for C and SC dogs, because of the low vaccine effectiveness for NC dogs (Figure \ref{fig:20vs70}).

### Discussion
Our analysis suggests that for larger free-roaming dog populations in India the use of oral baits for rabies vaccination may be an important part of vaccination campiagns that minimize cost, but still meet coverage targets. The use of these baits can represent a significant cost-saving for the campaign, even when the baits themselves are likely to cost significantly more than parenetal vaccines. 

Using cost estimates from previous work on dog vaccination in India, we show that the use of oral baits becomes more cost effective as both the proportion of never confined(NC) dogs, and the total population size of dogs increases. This finding holds even if the oral oral baits are quite expensive. We examined a wide range of possible per unit costs for oral baits, assuming that while currently baits would have to be imported at potentially high cost, in the future, they may have lower cost when domestic manufacture became possible. In 2019 Wallace suggested a price range of X while Giveson examined a range from 1.50-2.50. We find that even for prices as as high as 10x that of parental vaccines, the use of oral baits for NC dogs will still be more cost-effect because of the higher staffing and equipment needs, and hence higher costs, of catch, vaccinate, release methods (CVR), which are the only other feasible option for NC dogs.

For very small populations or low proportions of NC dogs, however, oral baits may no longer offer cost-savings over campaigns without such baits.  the lower coverage rates For the cost estimates used here, we find that oral baits should be employed for populations ....

The effect of percent of NC dogs and of population size, but not oral bait cost, do lend considerable uncertainty to whether  this method of vaccination should be employed in a campaign. The uncertainty about estimates of dog populations and NC dogs in particular can be quite large. Normally there is little survey data, and dog population estimates are created by using a fixed proportion of the known human populations. 

More generally, as the proportion of NC dogs increases, more vaccinations will be be required to achieve the same vaccination coverage rates, because of the lower effectiveness of methods for this class of dogs. Therefore, larger percentage of NC dogs will also lead to higher total campaign costs, as well as higher per dog costs.

Recent government initiatives in India, 

charitable organizations like Mission Rabies have completed pilot projects which suggest that oral baits will be a valuable contribution to India's campaign to eliminiate rabies. We demonstrate that not only would oral baits offer considerable cost-savings in most scenarios, they are part of the optimal solution for miniminal costs and maximum vaccine coverage in almost all scenarios.
